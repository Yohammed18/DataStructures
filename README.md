# DataStructures
Data structures are storages that are used to store and organize all sorts of data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

# BIG O NOTATION
O(1) Constant time
O(log2) Binary Search
O(n) Linear time
O(n^2)
O(2^n)

# ARRAYS
Pros: reading elements is easiest with the array O(1)
Cons: Since arrays are fixed in size once they are created, it's hard to insert or delete an element in the array. Often times you will have to generate a new array and add each element in the old array to the new array except for the one you are trying to delete, and in the case you are trying to add the same will apply.

# LINKED LIST
Pros: Great for Insertion and Deletion of elements. Uses a O(1) algorithm 
Cons: because the elements in a LinkedList are link to one another based on the address in memory you will have to use a 0(n) to find an element in the list.
